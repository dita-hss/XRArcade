*This will be a Christmas Themed arcade where you can do Christmas traditions!*

# Project Description

Currently, I am envisioning the arcade focusing on the user creating a gingerbread house. The user should be able to choose from different styles of walls, physically pick up the walls, and place them where they wish. In order to do this, the user should be able to move freely around the scene by either walking, by using the joystick, or both. The user should also be able to create gingerbread houses of whatever size they wish. If they would like to create a lifesize gingerbread house, they would be able to enter the house and continue building inside. There will also be different toppings that you would typically find such as gumdrops, candy canes, chocolate, and frosting. Once you indicate that you are finished with your gingerbread home, I envision the scene turns to night, fireworks appear, and santa clause arrives.

# Feature Breakdown

- Wall production and styling: The user is able to pick up a wall, resize it, rotate it, and style it.
  - Estimated challenge (2) - I predict what would take the most time would be finding and importing different styles for the user to pick from. I do not believe that picking up a wall, resizing it, or rotating it will take a significant amount of time.
- Door animation: The door of gingerbread house will open and close as indicated.
  - Estimated challenge (2): I believe this shouldn't take too long. However, creatig animations in Unity is somethig that I am not too familiar with. Therefore, it will require some research from me. 
- User movement: The user should be abe to move freely around the scene by walking, by using the joystick, or both. 
  - Estimated challenge (3): This is something that I have not implemented before, therefore I do believe there will be a bit of a learning curve with this as well. 
- Side Toppings: The user should be able to add decorations to their house such as gumdrops, candy canes, chocolate, and frosting.
  - Estimated challenge (2): Picking out the outside objects might be difficult based on availability. However, allowing user interaction similar to that of the wall should not be too difficult, especially once having completed the wall production. 
- Wall/toppings Interaction: Allowing the walls to lie on top of each other either with frosting or without frosting as the glue. Same scenario with the toppings.
  - Estimated challenge (3): This might be difficult accomplishing if I require a user to have frosting before gluing and object to the wall/floor. 
- Final Scene Surprise: Once the user is done with their house, they can indicate it somewhere on the scene revealing some animations such as fireworks, santa clause, and a night shift. 
  - Estimated challenge (5): I am very unsure on how I would do this with animations, especially if houses can be of different sizes. Additionally, actually having animations would be likely be a learning curve for me.
